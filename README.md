# GlobuzzerTask281218-Client-Side

This repository is created to hold the source code of the task requested by Globuzzer: to create a home page based on their design.

# The main targets here are:
 - To build a responsive web page whose design fits the origin as identically as possible.
 - To get some usable functions.
 - To connect with the backend to retrieve proper data.
 
#  What technologies?
  - Reactjs: 16.7.0
  - HTML5, CSS
  - Fontawesome for temporary icons.
  - Youtube embedded video links.
  - Google embedded map link.
  - Axios, Expressjs 4 and Mongodb for handling backend.
  
 
# Current archievements:
  - responsive up from 600px-width.
  - when user chooses a country, the page will be redirected to its dedicated page (backend involved).

# What needs to be considered?
  - because I do not have the design for lower than 600px-width (mobile version), so currently the web page will not function properly
  when scaling the page lower than 600px horizontally.
  - needs to add more transitions and animations, also icons as well.
  
# Pictures of the web page:
